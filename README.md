# Perspective-Projection
Perspective projection of an object using homogeneous coordinates and also visualizes transformations on a 3D graph.

This project builds off of a programming assignment given in COM S 477 taught by Dr. Yan-Bin Jia at Iowa State University. This program implements finding the projection matrix using a viewpoint and viewplane both given in homogeneous coordinates. The projection matrix is then applied to a matrix of homogeneous coordinates representing an object in 3D space. This program can also handle parallel projection as well.
